    <p>
        <strong>Hi, I am Juliana</strong> and I am currently an Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College in
        Ottawa, <abbr>CA</abbr>. I am 23 and I have a degree in Design from Los Andes University in Colombia from which
        I graduated in 2021. I have a passion for art, design and visual graphics but I have recently discovered a
        <em>huge interest</em> in web development. Growing up, I always learned through visual aids and today I am glad
        to be able to communicate with others through graphic design.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is my <b>3<sup>rd</sup></b> a freelance designer; creating both print and digital designs for different
        companies with opposing visual styles. I can say I am very versatile when it comes to adapting to contrasting
        branding styles, which is an advantage in today's fast paced industry. I also have 2 years of experience as a
        graphic designer in an advertising company. This is where I learned <mark>teamwork and efficiency</mark> to be
        able to deliver several creative designs every day.
    </p>
